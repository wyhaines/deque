# Deque

Deque is a wrapper around the standard C++ data structure of the same name. A Deque provides a queue structure that can efficiently handle insertions and removals of data from both the front and the back of the structure.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deque'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install deque

## Usage

The API is essentially the same as that of a Ruby Array.

* TODO: This code has been around in my toolbox for many years, and the API almost certainly can be cleaned up so that it is a much more feature-for-feature compatible struture to the current Ruby Array.
